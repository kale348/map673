14,Union Bridge,Wooden Covered Truss,1875,1907,40.443668,-80.013216,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Point/Union_1875.jpg,"The first bridge to be constructed at the Point was the Union Bridge over the Allegheny River. The bridge was the last wooden covered river bridge built in Pittsburgh. In 1902, it was declared an obstruction to navigation, as its clearance dropped to seven feet during high water."
15,First Point Bridge,Suspension,1877,1927,40.440397,-80.013569,Y,Monongahela,Photos/Point/Point_1877.jpg,"The Point Bridge Company was chartered in 1874 to span the Monongahela River. The resulting suspension bridge had an 83-foot vertical clearance to accommodate navigational needs. Unlike other suspension bridges, the catenaries were stiffened by trusses, allowing the bridge to be built for half the cost of comparable bridges."
16,Manchester Bridge,Metal Thru Truss,1915,1970,40.443853,-80.012428,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Point/Manchester_1915.jpg.jpg,"The replacement to the Union Bridge opened in 1915. Its two spans were constructed at different times to keep the river open for navigation. Upon completion, the 531-foot-long spans were among the longest in America. Stone portals were originally intended to be built at each portal. To reduce cost, metal sculptures were installed instead."
18,Second Point Bridge,Thru Truss,1927,1970,40.440254,-80.013322,Y,Monongahela,Photos/Point/Point_1927.jpg,The first Point Bridge was replaced by a larger structure in 1927. The city’s art commission mandated a design complementary to the Manchester Bridge to create a more unified appearance at the Point. The bridge was demolished in 1970 as part an urban renewal project that included the creation of Point State Park.

21,Fort Pitt Bridge,Arch,1959,,40.438944,-80.01115,Y,Monongahela,Photos/Point/Fort_Pitt_1959.jpg,"In order to develop the Point into a park, bridges needed to be replaced with ones located further from the Point. Double-decked bridges eliminated the need for intrusive flyover ramps. The innovative Fort Pitt Bridge was the first double-decked tied arch bridge and one of the earliest bridges designed with computer calculations."
23,Fort Duquesne Bridge,Arch,1969,,40.444294,-80.009307,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Point/Fort_Duquesne_1969.jpg,"The Fort Duquesne Bridge was designed to match the Fort Pitt Bridge. After over 40 years of planning, the new vision for the Point was fulfilled with the completion of the Fort Duquesne Bridge in 1969 and Point State Park in 1974. The Point became part of Pittsburgh’s identity, a public space uniting engineering, urban planning, landscape architecture, and art.  "

The bridge company’s director felt that an attractive Roebling bridge would increase revenue. He was right."
26,Third Sixth Street Bridge,Metal Thru Truss,1892,1927,40.4456,-80.00336,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Sixth_Street_1892.jpg,"By the 1890s, Roebling’s bridge was unable to carry the heavier electric trolleys. The replacement bridge by Theodore Cooper was built around Roebling’s bridge. Construction took 95 days. The bridge was dismantled in 1927 onto barges, floated along the river to be reused over the Ohio River to connect Coraopolis and Neville Island. The bridge lasted there until 1994."
28,First Seventh Street Bridge,Suspension,1884,1925,40.446,-80.00141,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Seventh_Street_1884.jpg,"By the 1880s, Pittsburgh and Allegheny City (now North Side) had grown to the point that investors felt there would be enough traffic for a crossing at Seventh Street. Gustav Lindenthal, who was working on the 1883 Smithfield Street Bridge, designed the suspension bridge."
29,First Ninth Street (Hand Street) Bridge,Wooden Covered Truss,1839,1890,40.4466,-79.99978,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Ninth_Street_1839.jpg,The first Hand (Ninth) Street Bridge was an 1839 wooden covered bridge.
29,Second Ninth Street Bridge,Metal Thru Truss,1890,1925,40.4466,-79.99978,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Ninth_Street_1890.jpg,"The first Hand (Ninth) Street Bridge was an 1839 wooden covered bridge. Pleasant Valley Electric Street Railway Company needed to replace its superstructure with stronger steel trusses to carry trolleys. The 1890 Baltimore truss (pictured) was designed by Ferris, Kaufman & Company. Ferris began designing the Ferris wheel a year later."
32,Andy Warhol Bridge (Seventh Street Bridge),Suspension,1926,,40.4466,-79.99978,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Seventh_Street_Andy_Warhol_1926.jpg,"In 1917, the US secretary of war mandated the replacement of low Allegheny River Bridges, including the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Street Bridges. The Municipal Art Commission vetoed initial designs, preferring three identical suspension bridges that minimized structural members above the bridge decks, preserving views of the city from the bridges. Engineers encountered unsatisfactory conditions for anchorages, so they designed the country's first self-anchored suspension bridges.

The Sixth Street Bridge was completed in 1928 and the Seventh and Ninth Street bridges in 1926. Known as the “Three Sisters,” the bridges have received many awards and commendations and have been featured in movies.

They are now named after baseball legend Roberto Clemente, artist Andy Warhol, and environmentalist Rachel Carson."

The company became the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago Railway, which replaced the wooden bridge in 1864 with a wrought iron lattice-girder (pictured) that lasted until 1904."
35,Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge,Metal Thru Truss,1904,,40.44807,-79.996081,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Fort_Wayne_Railroad_1904.jpg,"To accommodate railroad expansion and heavier locomotives, the 1904 Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge had two decks, separating local and through train traffic. In 1917, the War Department mandated that the bridge be raised 13 feet. Spans were simultaneously raised 3 to 15 inches per day over a period of six months."
36,Allegheny Aqueduct,Aqueduct,1829,1845,40.448578,-79.995335,Y,Allegheny,,"Early westward transportation routes bypassed Pittsburgh—the 1818 National Road was south, and the 1825 Erie Canal was north. Pittsburgh leaders campaigned in the state legislature to build a canal to Philadelphia. Routes along the Allegheny River were surveyed. The north bank was deemed most suitable, necessitating a wooden aqueduct across the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh at Eleventh Street, built in 1829."
36,Allegheny Aqueduct,Aqueduct,1845,1861,40.448578,-79.995335,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Allegheny_Aqueduct_1845.jpg,"Canal engineer John Roebling pioneered the technique of twisting strands of wire into rope. He designed a low-cost replacement bridge for the maintenance-intensive Allegheny Aqueduct using wire rope, and he successfully lobbied the canal company to build the bridge. He invented a mechanized process to band wire ropes together into cables to improve rigidity. Roebling’s 1845 aqueduct was an immediate success, launching his renowned bridge-engineering career."

It was a covered wooden bridge, which had to be rebuilt after an 1851 fire, and again following a flood in 1865. Deemed an obstruction to navigation in 1917, the bridge was destroyed by fire in 1919."
37,Sixteenth Street Bridge,Arch,1923,,40.4515,-79.99067,Y,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Sixteenth_Street_1923.jpg,"The present Sixteenth Street Bridge was completed in 1923.
