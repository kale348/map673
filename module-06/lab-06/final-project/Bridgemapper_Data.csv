Just a few wood planks from the deck remain. The 1997 West Virginia Atlas and Gazetteer shows a dashed line starting from Dorfee Road in Dorfee running along the east bank of the Elk River and crossing this bridge. Dorfee, established in 1907, was a mining community. Since this bridge could only be a pedestrian bridge, could it have been part of some sort of trail to get to the mines? Suspension bridges such as these are more commonly privately-owned, connecting to the property on the other side of the waterway. It is important to note that the cables extend above Elkhurst Road and are anchored into the hillside. Would this be allowed for a privately-owned bridge? Maybe it would be more likely for a mining company than a landowner.",,

Across the Ohio River was Woodlawn, a town eclipsed by the expansion of the Aliquippa Works of the Jones & Laughlin Steel Company. As the area grew and prospered, it became apparent that a bridge was needed. In 1926, the Ambridge-Woodlawn Bridge opened. The superstructure was built by the American Bridge Company, which was fitting since the bridge connected the company town to the J&L steel mill. Supposedly it was one of the easiest bridges to build, since it connected a steel mill with a bridge fabrication company. The substructure was built by Dravo Contracting. American Bridge built some of the largest bridges throughout the world, such as the New River Gorge Bridge in West Virginia and the East Bay Spans (both the original and the replacement) of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge. The Ambridge-Aliquippa Bridge, as it is now called, is one of the oldest surviving truss bridges over the Ohio River. It is also the only cantilever with four towers in Pennsylvania. It is the only one with four towers over the Ohio River upstream of Louisville, Kentucky. As such, the spans between the first and second towers and between the third and fourth act as anchor spans, giving the bridge three suspended spans (at the center and at the ends of the bridge).

It is not often when three bridges built at the same location on such an important route still survive. Well, sort of. In 1884, a iron six-span iron Whipple truss bridge was constructed at this location. Though the bridge was dismantled in 1910, half of it was re-erected over Onion Creek at Moore's Crossing in 1915. A flood destroyed those spans the same year. The remaining three spans were re-erected at that location in 1922, and they are still standing. The replacement Congress Avenue Bridge, completed in 1910, is an example of an open spandrel barrel arch. The barrel arch (solid arch) is much less common than the ribbed arch. In 1980, the bridge was reconstructed in which the piers were enlarged and the deck was removed. Load-bearing concrete box beams were installed from pier-to-pier over the arches. In other words, the Congress Avenue Bridge is a 1980's beam bridge built over the now-decorative 1910 bridge. If you visit the bridge, note the gap between the top of the arches and the beams. Building a new solid bridge over the old solid barrel arches also created an unintended consequence: the creation of an ideal bat roost.

The Wrought Iron Bridge Company of Canton, Ohio constructed York County Bridge 64 in 1893. The bridge is a good (albeit altered) example of a pin-connected wrought iron Pratt Through-truss Bridge. Pratt trusses were a bridge type popular in the mid-19th and early 20th Centuries for their ease of shop prefabrication and subsequent construction in the field, and for their weight-bearing capabilities. Bridge No. 64 replaced a ford used since 1821 at this location. The bridge is an altered example, but one of only five remaining wrought-iron pin-connected Pratt Through-truss bridges constructed by the Wrought Iron Bridge Company in York County. Records indicate conversion to a two-span structure by addition of a concrete center pier in 1954. Deteriorated stringers were replaced, the wooden deck was replaced with an open steel grate, and the steel guiderails were also installed in 1954. In 1993, York County Bridge No. 64 was determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing element to the Strickler's (Bair's) Mill Rural Historic District.

It was the second oldest truss bridge (not counting railroad-built bridges or back channel bridges) over the entire Ohio River! The bridge was also famous, since some scenes from the movie Silence of the Lambs were filmed on it. The Bellaire Bridge was one of three privately-owned bridges over the Ohio River between Ohio and West Virginia. In May 1991 the Interstate Bridge Company sold the right of way of the Ohio ramp to ODOT, who demolished the ramp to make room for the OH 7 freeway. Note that the ramp was at an angle to the bridge, connecting to 32nd Street. The bridge itself was sold to Roger Barack, who was going to reconnect the bridge with Bellaire, Ohio. This never happened because Mr. Barack was unable to obtain a permit. Barack tried again in the early 2000's, but was still unsuccessful. Since then this ''bridge to nowhere'' has sat as a barrier, separating Bellaire and Benwood. Other than the deck of the approach span, the bridge was in remarkably good condition. The bridge was undergoing refurbishment just prior to its closure, and most of the pins along the top chord were replaced. New floorbeams were also added to support the deck. With the bridge unused, the Coast Guard was concerned about the bridge collapsing and impeding navigation, and Norfolk Southern Railroad wanted a bridge pier off their property. Facing lawsuits, the bridge was sold in 2010 to a company to demolish the bridge for scrap. It is unlikely a new bridge will ever be built connecting Bellaire and Benwood.",,

The Beveridge Bridge, a single-lane suspension bridge, was constructed in 1896 to fill this need. The bridge was named for Irish immigrant John H. Beveridge, a former British merchant captain who settled in San Saba in 1849. He originally spanned the river with a dam known as the 'Beveridge Crossing.' By the 1890's locals petitioned county commissioners for a more reliable crossing. The Flinn-Moyer Company of Weatherford, Texas, built the Beveridge Bridge at a cost of $2275. County commissioners appointed John H. Beveridge to personally oversee the construction of the bridge that would replace his dam. Completed on June 24, 1896, the bridge was 190 feet long with a 140 foot suspended span. It extends approximately 300 feet between anchorages. The Beveridge Bridge withstood floods in 1899, 1922, and 1938. After the 1938 flood, county commissioners requested bids for its reconstruction. The Austin Bridge Company of Dallas was hired to carry out the work. In 1938, the bridge was reconstructed as an unstiffened suspension bridge with new parallel wire main cables spun in-situ on the original 1896 pipe truss towers using No. 9 gauge galvanized steel wire. In 2004, the bridge was closed to vehicular traffic due to deterioration of the main cable underground.

As built, it included a pedestrian sidewalk on the downstream side, which was later removed.'' The PAHBI has a different view of the bridge: ''The 145'-long and 16' wide, pin connected Pratt thru truss bridge is supported on ashlar abutments with wingwalls. It is dated 1898 based on the inscription on the masonry abutments. The trusses are traditionally composed, and the portal bracing is finished with a pediment-shaped strut with quadfoil punched decoration.

The upper chord/vertical connection consists of a pin plate placed inside of the toe-out channel built-up box section chord, and then riveted to angles which are in turn riveted to a plate located at the top of the vertical composed of toe-in angles with lacing. The rolled floorbeams are supported by two U-shaped hangers at each lower chord pin connection rather than the more common variation of one hanger. The bridge builder and date of construction are not documented by available records, but the bridge does reflect the variety of truss details used before widespread standardization and the preferences and activities of a fabricator active in this region of the state during the late-19th century. The bridge is historically and technologically significant as an increasingly rare and complete example of its type and design with distinctive details.'",,

Drivers trying to get to McKeesport had to make a right onto Bowman, make two more right turns, then a left turn, just to get to 5th Avenue at the bottom of the hill, east of Cliff Street (these streets were destroyed when the ca. 1970 interchange was built). The direct connection from the bridge to 5th Avenue was not completed until 1935, when Bowman Avenue was extended from the bridge over the Crooked Run Valley. This road was mostly built on fill, except for this rigid frame bridge built over Cliff Street. It seems that this connection and bridge should have been part of the original design. Note that the railings of the McKeesport Duquesne Bridge are integrated, also suggesting the structures were to be built together. Possibly the delay of the bridge was a result of the Great Depression, which started in 1929.

The road is long abandoned. Between Thompson Run Road and the bridge, Buena Vista Road Extension (aligned with what is now Rodi Road) shared a narrow tunnel, approximately 300 feet long, under the Union Railroad with Chalfant Run. The road would have only been suitable for one-lane of traffic with a low height clearance. Much of the Union Railroad (which connected United States Steel factories) was rebuilt and improved in the 1930's and 1940's, due to the increase in production to World War II. Maps from ca. 1910 do not indicate the existence of the Buena Vista Tunnel, since the alignment of Chalfant Run was different. Therefore, it is possible that the tunnel and realignment of Chalfant Run and Buena Vista Road Extension were all built as part of the Union Railroad reconstruction. Aerial photos from 1938 show both the bridge and tunnel. The next bridge upstream also is at the foot of a comparable tunnel under the Union Railroad. Though the tunnel is shown on the 1938 aerial photo, the road was not realigned to cross the creek after the tunnel until 1940. The bridge is a comparable stringer. This indicates that work was done circa 1940 to realign the roadways, not just the valleys. Therefore, it is likely that the abandoned Buena Vista Road Extension Bridge dates from the same period, but prior to 1938.",,

In 2002 the replacement Carey Avenue Bridge opened to traffic, and the old bridge over the river was subsequently demolished. Only this pony truss span over the abandoned railroad remains. According to the PAHBI, ''The single span, 137'-long, steel Parker pony truss bridge is supported on ashlar abutments with concrete caps. The bottom chord and floor system are encased in concrete. The vertical and diagonal members are rolled sections, and the top chords are built-up members. Standard pipe railings with bar fill are placed to the inside faces of the trusses. The Parker truss, a variation of the Pratt truss with polygonal top chord, was developed by American engineer Charles Parker in the early 1870s. The rivet connected Parker truss was adopted by the state highway department as a standard in the 1920s because the well established technology offered an economic alternative to other bridge types in a span range of approximately 100' to 250'.''",,

Company trademarks include the extensive use of I-beams and bolted connections, such as those on the lower chords, which the company called lap-jointed ''Flat Bar Chords.'' The company's designs reflect the experimentation that characterizes early truss bridge designs. The Columbia Bridge Works of Dayton, Ohio was established in 1852 by David H. Morrison (1817-1882), Dayton's first city engineer. Morrison ranks among the earliest engineers to recognize the possibilities of metal truss bridge technology, establishing one of the first bridge companies in the nation, and reportedly building the first all-iron bridge west of the Allegheny Mountains. The firm specialized in Morrison's patented designs, the most successful of which was a bowstring arch-truss built throughout the Midwest in the 1860s and 1870s. In the early 1870s, the Columbia Bridge Works began to produce variations of the Pratt truss design. Like many bridge builders of the period, Morrison developed a number of distinctive, idiosyncratic details. Trademarks were the extensive use of I-beams, which Morrison correctly believed to be an ideal shape for primary members, and bolted lower chord connections that Morrison called lap jointed ''Flat Bar Chords.'' He claimed that the chords increased stiffness and reduced vibrations from large moving loads. Morrison passed away in 1882, but his company continued under the direction of his son, Charles Carroll Morrison, who had joined as a partner in 1868.

According to the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER), ''The Carquinez Bridge is a cantilever truss structure which carries three lanes of westbound Interstate-80 traffic across the Carquinez Strait. (Eastbound I-80 traffic is carried by a parallel structure, erected in 1958.) The 1927 bridge was the first major auto bridge in the San Francisco Bay Area, predating by a decade the Golden Gate and San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridges. Replacing an auto ferry across the Carquinez Strait, the bridge was an important link in north-south traffic from the Bay Area to Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, as well as connecting the Bay Area to Sacramento and points east. The bridge's importance as a north-south link diminished somewhat with the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937, but it remains a critical highway link between the Bay Area and Sacramento, carrying an average of more than fifty thousand vehicles per day. With two main spans of 1100' each, the Carquinez Bridge at the time of its completion was the fourth largest cantilever truss bridge in the world, and the second largest in the United States. (The Queensboro Bridge in New York City, constructed in 1909, was the largest cantilever truss bridge in the U.S., with spans of 984' and 1182'.) Only five bridges of any type in the U.S. had spans exceeding 1100' in 1927 (the four being suspension spans). The Carquinez Bridge was the largest bridge west of the Mississippi River, and the first major bridge designed to resist seismic forces. One of the biggest challenges for the engineers was the construction of piers in the deep and swift waters of the Carquinez Strait. Two of the bridge's piers extend approximately 135' below mean high water to bedrock, through 80'-90' of water and 45'-55' of earth beneath the channel. These were the deepest water piers ever constructed at that time, a record later surpassed by the Golden Gate and San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridges.''",,

However, a 2009 inspection revealed dangerous deterioration in some pins and vertical members. One of the 200-foot approach span pin hangers had bent directly over the railroad tracks. This may have been due to the steel being weakened from the steam trains that had been in use when the bridge opened. The bridge was demolished on July 11, 2011. The new bridge, a steel girder, will open to traffic in either late 2012 or early 2013. The new bridge will reuse the 1985 approach spans. It will be named after John Tener. After serving the area for over 100 years, the new bridge is anticipated to serve the area for the next 100 years.",,

Graham (County Engineer), Wendell P. Brown (Consulting Engineer), The Roberts Supply Company of Lima, Ohio (Contractor)",2006,"The Chestnut Street Viaduct was one of two open spandrel concrete arch bridges in Mercer County as of 2000. By 2008, both were replaced. According to the Mercer County Engineer's Office website, ''Mercer County Bridge No. 3116 was a structure eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. An Historic Bridge Recordation document was prepared to permit replacement of this structure. The Chestnut Street Bridge was located between Harvard and McConnell Streets in the Borough of Grove City, Mercer County, Pennsylvania and spanned Wolf Creek. The reinforced concrete, six-span bridge was built in 1930 to improve vehicular and pedestrian access between sections of the borough bisected by the creek. The bridge had an overall length of 312 feet (95 meters), and consisted of three adjacent open spandrel concrete arch spans on the east and three adjoining concrete T-beam spans to the west. The 92 foot (28-meter) long channel span over Wolf Creek was the largest of the bridge's six spans and was flanked on either side by a 44-foot (13.4-meter) open spandrel span. The arch span ribs had an approximate width of 3.5 feet (1 meter) in width and were strengthened by perpendicular concrete struts at the crown and spring lines of the main arch. The arch spans adjoined to a series of three 44-foot (13.4-meter) long T-beam spans on the west. Immediate access to the bridge was provided by a 76.5-foot (23-meter) long approach fill within retaining walls near McConnell Street on the west and a 40-foot (12-meter) approach fill with retaining walls near Harvard Street on the east. Bridge width was 34 feet (10.4 meters) from outer parapet edges, and included a 20-foot (6.1-meter) wide asphalt-paved roadway flanked by two five-foot wide sidewalks. Along the northern and southern elevations, the parapets consisted of forty reinforced concrete panels, each measuring approximately 3 feet (0.95 meters) in height by 7 feet (2.12 meters) in width. Aluminum tube handrails at the eastern terminus of the bridge provided additional protection against the steep slopes below Harvard Street. The six Chestnut Street Bridge spans were supported by ten square concrete piers (i.e., five along each elevation); these were set on squared concrete footings and had been scored on their outer face to imitate cut stone blocks. The steeply curved eastern reinforced concrete abutment at Harvard Street was stepped and received the base of the easternmost arch at the spring line. The western bridge abutment was square in form and served as a transition between the free-standing T-beam portion of the bridge and the adjacent earthen approach fill that leads to McConnell Street. The Chestnut Street Bridge contained two metal bridge plaques; these were situated along the northern and southern inner parapet walls, near Harvard and McConnell Streets, respectively. Both plaques were identical and listed the structure's official bridge number (Mercer County Bridge No. 3116) and its 1930 completion date. The plaques also identify the County Commissioners at the time of construction (W A. Bone, Harry Hunter, and Harry Gibson and lists Frank P. Graham (Mercer County engineer) and Wendell P. Brown (consulting engineer) as the designers of the bridge. The Roberts Supply Company of Lima, Ohio was listed as the builder. These plaques were transferred to the Mercer County Historical Society for preservation. Urban development in the project vicinity during the 1920s led directly to the construction of the Chestnut Street Bridge in 1930. According to the minutes of the Mercer County Commissioners, the commissioners entered into an agreement with Grove City Borough authorizing construction of the bridge on June 17, 1929. Construction bids from 11 competing Pennsylvania and Ohio firms were opened on September 10, 1929, and the contract awarded to the Roberts Supply Company of Lima, Ohio, for its low bid of $66,300 At the time of its 1930 completion, the Chestnut Street Bridge was the longest bridge in the county and was one of four Grove City bridges carrying automotive traffic across Wolf Creek during the early 1930s. The Chestnut Street Bridge is a significant representative example of the many reinforced concrete automotive bridges built across Pennsylvania and surrounding states during the first half of the twentieth century to facilitate efficient transportation within the state's emerging highway system. Construction of the bridge in 1930 contributed to Grove City Borough's increasing integration within the local and regional economy. The construction of the bridge in 1930 occurred as part of an evolutionary trend in bridge design that sought to improve the strength, ease of construction, and cost-effectiveness of highway bridges, using lighter and stronger materials.''",,

This is characteristic of Penn Bridge Company bridges from the 1870's through the 1880's. Some original plates which cover the extended top chord give the date as 1888. The bridge is similar to the Evans Bridge. In 1984 the bridge was rehabilitated, at which time a sidewalk was added, some floorbeams were replaced, and cover plate was welded to the bottom of the upper chords. Although this impacted the historic integrity of the bridge, it also gave the bridge a sufficiency rating of near 50 percent.",,

It demonstrates that concrete can be economical and aesthetically pleasing while showing that the material is well suited to the challenges of an unusually wide crossing. The span between Columbia and Wrightsville Carried the Lincoln Highway, which was traveled by increasing numbers of motorists in the late 1920's. [The Lincoln Highway was the nation's first coast to coast route]. The construction of the Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge was a cooperative effort between Lancaster and York counties, an innovation in itself, to relieve traffic jams caused by the previous bridge. [The previous bridge was shared with the Pennsylvania Railroad. Traffic was stopped on the bridge whenever a train needed to cross]. The Wiley-Maxon Construction Company made the most of the site's advantages and used creative means to adapt the extreme length of the bridge, approximately 1.26 miles. The span continued to carry the bulk of traffic between Lancaster and York counties until a wider [steel and] concrete girder bridge was constructed upstream along the U.S. 30 bypass in 1971. The Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark on 16 October 1984. Today it continues to serve traffic on State Route 462.'' HAER states, ''When it was dedicated on Armistice Day, 1930, the Columbia Wrightsville Bridge was the longest multiple-concrete arch bridge in the world. Twenty-eight three-ribbed open-spandrel reinforced concrete arches, each spanning 185'-0'', carry the bridge across the Susquehanna between Lancaster and York counties. Another twenty spans make up the bridge's 6657'-0'' total length. The span's construction was innovative because it involved the cooperative effort of the two counties. Four bridges preceded this span at this historically important river crossing. The Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1984 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.'' The piers of the previous bridge remain to the north of the current structure. The second structure was destroyed during the Civil War, just prior to the Battle of Gettysburg. According to HAER, ''On 28 June 1863, Confederate troops were marching north under command of General John B. Gordon in an effort to capture Philadelphia when they reached the Wrightsville shore. Union forces on the Columbia shore first tried to blow up the bridge. When that effort failed, they set the entire structure on fire to prevent the Confederates from crossing the Susquehanna.''

It is a significant example of a metal truss bridge because it exhibits transitional technology with its use of steel, cantilevering, and two kinds of joinery methods. Both pin and rivet connection techniques are in evidence on this bridge.'' HAER elaborates on the bridge with the following documentation: ''The Coverts Crossing Bridge was built at a time of technological transition and innovation, reflected in both its relatively early use of steel rather than iron, and in its cantilever design. Its construction in 1887 occurred within 10 years of the nation's first all-steel truss bridge, erected over the Missouri River by the Chicago & Alton Railroad in 1878-1879.... The use of a cantilever truss design in the Coverts Crossing Bridge was a relatively early engineering response to its overall length of 301 feet (91.6 meters) across the Mahoning River, a major regional drainage. The bridge's transitional character is also evident in its reliance on both pin connections and rivets to join its various structural members. The use of rivets in American bridge construction was rare before the 1890's. Historically, American bridge builders continued to use pin connections long after their British counterparts had switched to the use of rivets. During the late nineteenth century, this American technological conservatism was driven by both economic factors and safety considerations. Bridges using pin connections required substantially less construction time and were considered safer than structures joined by rivets.... Several other engineering aspects of the bridge reflect an unusual degree of non-standardization in design and construction. These include the use of pin-connected eyebars to form the lower bridge chord of the southernmost truss section, while riveted steel channels (girder guides) were used to form the lower chords among the central and northern truss sections. Also notable are the markedly divergent ornamental styles found on the northern and southern portal gussets; decoration on the northern gusset consists of a geometric field of circles, while the southern gusset involves a cloverleaf-like pattern. The use of these various non-standardized components suggests that the bridge fabricators utilized whatever stock materials happened to be on hand when the materials for the bridge were ordered in 1887, and/or that no specific, standardized pattern set was available at the time of construction.''",,

The structure is unusual for several different reasons. It is an extremely rare example of a cantilever in which the entire top chord is divided into only 9 sections. With most cantilevers, the top chord curves upwards to form pointed towers. With the Dick Henderson Bridge, the top chord has a linear upwards slope and towers with flat tops. It is the only cantilever bridge like it in the area. In the early 1930's, virtually all steel bridges were comprised of built up v-laced compression members. The Dick Henderson Bridge only uses rolled H-section beams for all of its members. H-section rolled beams did not even begin to be used on bridges until around 1920. The beams are more often seen on bridges from around 1940 and beyond, making the Dick Henderson Bridge look much more modern than it is. Unfortunately, the bridge is to be replaced around 2013.

The road, completed in 1960, eventually was designated as I-70. However, there was no good connection between the important industrial center of Donora and I-70, several miles to the south. In the 1970's, industry along the Monongahela River was in decline as cheaper imports and lack of good road access strangled industry in the valley. As a result, PennDOT planned to built a new Mon Fayette expressway parallel to the river and a highway connecting the expressway with Donora and I-70. The first component to be built was the Donora Monessen Bridge, a deck cantilever with a 608-foot main span, the longest truss span over the entire Monongahela River. The bridge was begun in 1972 and opened in 1974. Unfortunately, highway expansion slowed to a halt in the late 1970's with the collapse of the manufacturing industry and the fuel price shocks. It was not until 1989 that the connection to I-70, the C. Vance DeiCas Highway, was built. While the Mon Fayette Expressway finally opened in the region in 2002, the connection to the Donora Monessen Bridge was never built. While the bridge does serve as a crucial highway link to Donora, it is lightly traveled because little industry exists to use it. The bridge was rehabilitated in 2009 for around $20 million.

It was considered to be ''another important link to the march of progress in Donora.'' Rebecca Donora Castner, the first person to be born in Donora, cut the ribbon to open the bridge. Much has changed in Donora since then. At first industry brought prosperity, but then, tragedy. In 1948, an inversion of smoke and fog killed 20 people, the infamous event known as the Donora Smog. Within the next 30 years, most of the industry that brought wealth to the town shut down, leaving hard times behind. The bridge is one of the few relics that remain. But for how long? In 2009, an inspection revealed dangerous deterioration, closing the bridge to traffic. Options stated at public meetings included removing the bridge for $2.5 million, repairing the bridge for $15.15 million, restoring the bridge for $21.82 million, or replacing the bridge for $25 million. Does it make sense to spend tens of millions to rehabilitate the bridge or replace the bridge since it is lightly used? Does it make sense to spend money to repair the bridge even though the bridge will still have height and weight restrictions? The federal Section 106 Process will therefore be followed to determine the best course of action for the bridge. Some bridges, like the Smithfield Street Bridge and the Old Brownsville Bridge, have been rehabilitated. Others, like the nearby Monongahela Bridge, have been replaced. Even if the bridge is demolished, through the Section 106 process the bridge will probably be documented. Other than the Smithfield Street Bridge, the Donora Webster Bridge is the last remaining multi-span pin-connected truss bridge over the entire Monongahela River. It is the oldest bridge over the river outside of Allegheny County. It also is noteworthy for its 515-foot main span, likely the longest in all of Western Pennsylvania (possibly in all of Pennsylvania) when it was built.

It found limited application for spans in the range of 100' to 200' because of the economy of design of the polygonal top chord which offered bridge engineers the ability to vary the depth of the trusses, and thus achieve savings of material. By 1890, the Pratt and Pratt variation truss designs, including camelback, had emerged as the most popular of the pin-connected designs because of their simplicity of design and economy of fabrication and erection, especially the use of eye bars to facilitate field connections.

It is one of the most significant bridges in America. In the early 1800's, the National Road (Cumberland Road) was built through the important port of Brownsville, Pennsylvania, along the Monongahela River. The first two bridges on this site collapsed, and the third lasted only 12 years before it needed to be replaced. All metal truss bridges had not yet been used in America, and such a large stone arch bridge was very difficult to build. The Army Corps of Engineers decided to do something unprecedented in America -- design a cast iron arch. The first cast iron arches in the world were built in England starting in the late 1700's. However, in America, cast iron arch bridges were prohibitively expensive; only the Federal Government could afford them. The bridge opened to traffic in 1838 and was completed in 1839. Since then, the only major modification was the addition of sidewalks. Due to the growth of trade at Brownsville, located at the intersection of the National Road and the navigable Monongahela River, the town prospered in the early 1900's. There was such a demand for retail space along the road that stores were built over the creek on either side of the bridge. However, when heavy industry collapsed and a new alignment of US 40 was built bypassing the town, the Brownsville Bottoms area surrounding the bridge was all but abandoned. Hopefully the area surrounding the bridge will be redeveloped to show off and promote such a nationally significant bridge.",,

The superstructure was replaced, but the original piers still remain. Somehow, this bridge over the Elk River was never replaced. Eventually it will be converted to carry a rail trail (as part of Phase 2; the Kanawha River Bridge is Phase I). This conversion will allow many people to enjoy one of the most historic bridges in the state.",,

The Auburn Dam and Reservoir was to be the final dam and lake system of the Central Valley Project. However, during preliminary construction of the dam, an earthquake occurred in a fault thought to be dormant near Oroville in 1977. Construction halted, and similar faults were found under the dam site. A redesign of the dam was found to be too costly, especially since dam was not crucial for flood control since Folsom Dam already existed downstream. As a result, construction of the dam never resumed. Therefore, with a height of 730 feet, the Foresthill Bridge will remain the fourth highest bridge in America, behind only the Royal Gorge Bridge, New River Gorge Bridge, and Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge. The bridge is also one of the largest cantilever truss bridges in America, with a main span of 862 feet. Due to its height, the bridge was used in the movie, xXx, in which Vin Diesel's character drove a Corvette off the bridge and parachuted away to escape pursuit. The bridge is also noteworthy that while it was designed to accommodate four lanes of traffic plus shoulders, only the two outside lanes were built, due to the relatively low traffic volume of Foresthill Road. Therefore, the center of the bridge has no deck. The inside lanes will only be added if warranted by increased traffic volumes.",,

The article, ''Modern Engineering Accomplished Wonder,'' from the Oil City Derrick on August 23rd, 1921, provides an account of replacing the 1883 bridge with the 1921 bridge: ''Foxburg, Pa. Aug 22. The substitution of a new steel span, 180 feet long and weighing 400 tons, for a section of the old double locked wooden railroad bridge over the Allegheny at this point, the work of making the change occupying an actual period of only 10 minutes, was an engineering fete witnessed early today by practically all the inhabitants of this place. Placing of the new span was the first step in the reconstruction of the old bridge which is one of the last wooden railroad bridges left in the country. Two more spans of the same weight and dimensions as the first will be put in place, one on September 18 and the other October 16. The method employed by the engineers in making the substitution was apparently simple. The new steel structure was built alongside of the old wooden span, false work erected on the upstream side. Similar false work was built out on the down stream side. Both old and the new structures were set on several hundred small rollers and when all was ready cables which had been rigged from two railroad cranes were attached to the steel span and the signal to pull was given. As the new span rolled from its position it pushed the old structure from its place on the stone piers to a resting place on the false work on the down stream side. Both spans made the journey in less than 10 minutes and an hour later the bridge was ready for regular train service. The work was under the direction of P. J. Lang, bridge engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio railroad and A. C. Clark, district engineer of the same road.'' The last section of the bridge was erected on October 16, 1921.

The bridge was proposed by an article in the San Francisco Bulletin in 1916. The bridge finally completed 21 years later. Answering the proposal, Joseph Strauss initially proposed a cantilever bridge to cross the Golden Gate (similar to the original East Spans of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge). The design was changed to a suspension. Since Joseph Strauss had little experience with suspension bridges, senior engineer Charles Alton Ellis was the principal engineer for the project. Even after being fired in 1931, Ellis continued to work on the project, though he had to do so without pay. Construction began on January 5, 1933 and finished in April of 1937 at a cost of over $35 million. Eleven workers were killed during construction. Today the bridge is one of the most famous and most admired in the world. About 120,000 vehicles cross the bridge every day, and thousands more walk and bike across it.

With the upcoming demolition of the Hallton Bridge, this once common bridge type will become extinct in the state. The Hallton Bridge is for sale through the PennDOT bridge marketing program, though the responsible party to assume ownership must relocate the bridge. According to the PAHBI, ''The 1898, single span, 129'-long, pin-connected Pratt thru truss bridge is supported on ashlar abutments. It has eye bars and rods for the tension members, and built-up compression members. Rolled floorbeams with U-shaped hangers support timber stringers and a wood deck. The stringers and deck in one panel are failed, accounting for the bridge's closure. The failure does not affect integrity of original design. [In 1997 the bridge was repaired and reopened to traffic]. The bridge is finished with lattice railings and lattice portals with built-up curved knee braces with twisted bars in a fan shape. According to the township supervisor, the 1898 date of construction was recorded from a bridge plaque before the plaque was lost. The builder is undocumented [but stylistically is attributed to the Horseheads Bridge Company]. The bridge is a long example of its type and design with it original decorative elements. Pin-connected truss bridges are increasingly rare, especially in this region of the state, with fewer than 20 documented examples from ca. 1880 to 1910 surviving in PADOT Dist. 2-0. This is one of the most complete and earliest to document the all standard details that came to characterize the pin-connected Pratt truss type/design in the 1890s.

It is also possible that both spans were originally identical, and that the southern span was damaged and replaced in 1913. The northern span appears to have been constructed in ca. 1900. Note that the compression members' V-lacing is perpendicular to the deck. Most truss bridges (including the southern span), have V-lacing parallel to the deck. Wrought Iron Bridge Company bridges are the exceptions, though this bridge does not have other matching details.

The lightly built trusses have lower chords and diagonals of eye bars, and upper chords, end posts, and verticals of channels with lacing. The bridge has lattice portal bracing and built-up upper laterals with an inverted fishbelly shape. The floorbeams, stringers and deck were replaced in 1995, but the floorbeams were reconnected to the trusses in the original manner with U-shaped hangers from the lower chord pins. The end panel lower chord members were post tensioned with rods placed to the inside of the eye bars. The bridge is among the early examples of its type/design in the region. The 1995 deck replacement was sensitive to the original fabric/appearance. The Variety Iron Works, a Cleveland, Ohio, fabricator, built bridges from ca. 1888-1907, but was most active in the 1890s. The bridge's date of construction is undocumented by available records but ca. 1890 is appropriate based on company history and style. The bridge is a historically and technologically significant example of its type/design with distinctive details like the lattice web end posts and the fact that is a rare instate example of the fabricator.'' According to historicbridges.org, ''The bridge displays several noteworthy, distinctive, or uncommon, details, many of them associated with the Variety Ironworks. The pedimented design of the struts is present on all known through trusses built by the company, and the design of the portal bracing is seen on nearly all of the known trusses built by the company. The use of lattice instead of cover plate, particularly on the top chord (except at the center two panels), is another design the company often used. This particular bridge also has lattice on the top of the endpost as well, which is an uncommon feature among highway truss bridges of this period in history. The hip verticals have up-set eyebars that have an uncommon shape (not circular) which is an unusual detail that has shown up on other Variety Ironworks spans.''",,

The bridge was to be replaced by a single tower cable-stayed bridge to open in 2008 or 2009. However, due to significant increases in construction prices between 2003 when final design began and 2006, the cost of the new bridge ballooned to $110 million, 30% over budget. As a result, the design for the new bridge was changed to a two tower cable-stayed bridge. Due to the delays from the redesign, the new bridge will not open until around 2015. In the meantime, ODOT spent $1.1 million in 2008 to make repairs to the Ironton Russell Bridge. The bridge was last rehabilitated in the 1970's, in which plates were welded onto the bridge, weakening the members. The welding violated welding codes. Today the bridge is closed when temperatures go below -5 degrees F. Only vehicles narrower than 7.5 feet are allowed to use the bridge. The bridge is also unusual in that ramps on both sides are perpendicular to the bridge, connecting streets that are parallel with the river.

Approximately 15 pin connected Parker truss highway bridges survive statewide [as of 1998, many have since been replaced], and only three date from before 1900. Adding to its significance is its association with the Penn Bridge Company, a prolific regional fabricator of metal truss bridges.

The abandoned and dewatered canal and stone canal lock chamber is located a short distance southwest of the bridge. The Penn Bridge Company of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, was organized in 1868 as T.B. White & Sons. At the time, the firm constructed wooden bridges. The plant was initially established in New Brighton; it was moved across the Beaver River to Beaver Falls in 1878. In 1887, the firm reorganized and incorporated as the Penn Bridge Company, producers of wrought iron, steel, and combination bridges; iron substructures, buildings, and roof trusses; and plate, box, and lattice girders and architectural ironwork. In the 1890s, the Penn Bridge Company's output averaged 5,000 long tons, ranking it as a small bridge fabricator. The Penn Bridge Company remained independent of the American Bridge Company, and continued to grow over the first two decades of the twentieth century, producing large and small structures and structural steel work. The company added new physical plant in 1902, reincorporated in 1905, and employed more than 500 workers in 1908. The Penn Bridge Company built bridges and structures in nearly all U.S. states and territories. It was particularly prominent in Pittsburgh, the City of Bridges. By 1908, the company had built four bridges over the Ohio River, five over the Monongahela River, and two over the Allegheny River, as well as the original Ohio River Dam Nos. 2, 4, 5, and 6.''",,

It was designed by Octave Chanute and built by the Phoenix Iron Works using Phoenix columns, which are hollow iron tubes. The bridge was probably the largest built ever to use Phoenix columns. The entire structure was built in just 94 days. When the bridge was completed, it was the tallest and longest bridge in the world, with a height of 300 feet and length of 2100 feet. It was advertized as the 'Eighth Wonder of the World.' The bridge held the record until Gustave Eiffel's Garabit Viaduct in France opened in 1885. As railroad loads became heavier, the Erie Railroad (which merged with the NYLE&W) hired the Elmira Bridge Company to rebuild the structure, which was done from May through September of 1900. The bridge was rebuilt in which Howe truss 'timber travelers' were placed, starting at one tower, spanning over a second tower, and ending at a third tower. Therefore, the intermediate tower could be rebuilt. This process was repeated until the entire bridge was rebuilt. The anchor bolts which attached the base of the towers to the stone and concrete footings were reused from the previous bridge. The rebuilt Kinzua Viaduct was used by the Erie Railroad until 1959. It was to be torn down in the early 1960's. However, when Nick Kovalchick, the owner of the bridge's salvage company saw the bridge, he supposedly said, 'There will never be another bridge like this.' Kovalchick successfully worked together with preservation groups to convince the DCNR to buy the land to become the Kinzua Bridge State Park. The park was established in 1963 and opened in 1975. The bridge was refurbished in which sidewalks and railings were added for pedestrians. The bridge also continued to function as a railroad bridge for the Knox and Kane Railroad's sightseeing trips. In 2002, the bridge was closed to railroad and pedestrian traffic when an inspection revealed the anchor bolts (the original ones from the previous bridge) were badly rusted. A strong wind could blow the bridge off its footings, leading to catastrophic collapse. Construction began in early 2003 to repair the bridge. Unfortunately, time ran out. On July 21, 2003 the bridge was struck by an F1 tornado, with wind speeds of 94 miles per hour. Only the three northern towers and the six southern towers that had just been repaired withstood the storm. The rest lie as they fell on the valley floor below.

Two stone arch bridges were built: The Great Crossings Bridge (Youghiogheny) and the Little Crossings Bridge (Casselman). Construction began on the Little Crossings Bridge in 1813. With a main span of 80 feet and a height of 30 feet, it was America's longest-spanning stone arch bridge when it opened. Supposedly, the large arch was built to accommodate a potential C&O Canal extension to Pittsburgh that was never built. In the 1930's, much of the National Road (also known as the Cumberland Road) was widened and realigned. The Little Crossings Bridge was bypassed in 1933 by a Pratt truss on a realignment of the National Road. In the mid-1950's, the Little Crossings Bridge was restored.

By the late 1800's, the old bridge was overwhelmed by traffic congestion and newer electric streetcars. In 1894, legislation was passed authorizing the Boston Transit Commission, the new Cambridge Bridge (Longfellow Bridge), the Charlestown Bridge, and the Tremont Subway. The Cambridge Bridge Commission was organized in 1898 to design and build the bridge. The commission chose William Jackson as Chief Engineer and Edmund Wheelwright as Architect. They traveled to Europe to find inspiration for the new Cambridge Bridge by studying similar bridges. According to Massachusetts and War Department regulations, the new bridge had to either provide sufficient vertical clearance for navigation or be a moveable bridge. The Cambridge Bridge Commission successfully lobbied both agencies to permit the new bridge to be a stationary bridge, since a moveable span would not be consistent in appearance with the other stationary spans, and it would add to the cost of the bridge. Note the bridge was designed with towers flanking the center span, a design typically used in drawbridges. For moveable bridges, a tower provides an operations room for the bridge tender. The design of a stationary bridge set a precedent for all bridges upstream of the Longfellow Bridge. In choosing a steel arch bridge, the commissioners wrote that the bridge would ''furnish the eastern boundary of a great park system along 18 miles of river...destined to be the most beautiful park in the country. It is the present purpose, to make the new Cambridge Bridge one of the finest and most beautiful structures in the world.'' The towers are ornamented with granite sculptures to depict a hypothetical voyage of Leif Eriksson up the Charles River. The bridge is also decorated with the city seals of Boston and Cambridge. Construction began in 1900, the bridge was completed in 1906, and rail service began in 1912. It was renamed the Longfellow Bridge in 1927. In service for over 100 years, the bridge still stands as one of the longest steel arch bridges in America (in total length).

It is also one of only a few short-span suspension bridges in the state. In a conventional suspension bridge design, the deck is stiffened by deck, pony, or thru trusses. Vertical suspender cables (or eyebars) connect the deck in tension with the main continuous cables or eyebar chains. In the design of the Lower Bridge, the web of the bridge is comprised of a pin-connected truss. Vertical members are built up compression members; the diagonal eyebars between the panels support the bridge in tension. The entire webbing acts as bracing, eliminating the need for the stiffening truss. With possibly no other bridges like it remaining anywhere, it is paramount that the bridge is preserved. ",,

The first bridge crossing the Trinity River at Main Street was a metal deck truss erected in 1889. This structure was replaced by a two-lane wire suspension bridge which proved to be inadequate to handle the increased traffic. The principal constraints facing Bowen in the design of the Main Street Viaduct were related to the unstable soil conditions of the site and to the unpredictable nature of the Trinity River. . . . The three-hinged arch was selected because it would not be strained by unequal settlement. Also, the three-hinged arch is a statically determinate form, meaning that stresses can be easily computed for design and secondary temperature stresses are eliminated. Ribbed construction was adopted because it is light and best adapted to the use of hinges, and also because no waterproofing would be required. . . . The Main Street Viaduct has been altered from its original construction by removal of the original railings. However, the basic structure of the bridge remains unchanged.

The bridge has rolled stringers and wood plank deck. Built-up girders, to make an I-beam section of sufficient depth to span greater distances than possible with the available rolled beams, were developed by the railroads in the late 1840s, and the technology proved to be the only serious competitor to the metal truss for railroad use in the 19th century. Taking advantage of the tensile strength of wrought iron and later steel, the built-up girder, which could be fabricated off site and easily transported and then hoisted into position, proved to be a boon to the railroads.

Some early examples have lattice webs rather than solid webs. The bridge is historically and technologically significant as among the earliest surviving examples of its type/design in Pennsylvania. The 1-lane bridge over a single active railroad track in a cut is closed to traffic. Woods are to all quadrants, although the area has scattered 19th to late 20th century buildings. The setting does not have the cohesiveness or integrity of a historic district. The rail line is the former Central RR of NJ main line from Easton to Wilkes-Barre, completed in 1866. The line was primarily an anthracite coal hauler.''",,

This number will likely drop to one, the Old Brownsville Bridge, by the mid-2010's. The Masontown Bridge was supposed to be demolished in 2005, although the project was pushed back to the early 2010's due to lack of funding. With the Masontown Bridge project, PA Route 21 is to be widened and realigned (again), and a new four-lane bridge is to be built over the Monongahela River. Eventually this will permit a four-lane highway from PA 88 all the way to Uniontown. The new bridge is to be constructed in stages, with a two lane section to be built next to the existing bridge. Then the existing bridge will be demolished and the other two lanes of the new bridge built. According to the PAHBI, ''The 11 span, 1,458' long and 25' wide bridge is composed of three built up thru girder spans at each end, one 127' long Warren with verticals and polygonal top chord pony truss, three 187' long Parker thru truss spans and one 402' long Pennsylvania thru truss river span.

According to FrostTownHistoricSite.org, ''The unique design of the McKee Street Bridge was a response to the challenge of creating a bridge that could provide adequate clearance for small craft navigating Buffalo Bayou. The sharp angle of the bayou at this location created an additional obstacle in building a bridge. After considering several spanning technologies, city bridge engineer, J.G. McKenzie utilized a continuous through-girder configuration. The selected design provided adequate horizontal clearance with a 120' span over the main channel of the bayou. To compensate for the angle of the crossing, the bridge was build on a skew with the piers and abutments laid out with their downstream footings offset by arranging the floor beams over the supports at perpendicular angles. The unusual appearance of the bridge is a result of designing the girders to follow the calculated bending moment curve. The two curves that rise as waves above the roadway represent the reverse curve created by the intersection of two simple parabolas at a point of tangency 15' out from the center of each support.''",,

It is considered by many to be nationally significant. The bridge consists of a two 1872 cast and wrought iron Whipple trusses built with Keystone Columns supplemented by two 1912 Baltimore trusses. In 1907, the Northwestern Pennsylvania Trolley Company began running street cars across the bridge. It soon became apparent that the bridge was not strong enough to carry the trolley cars, and temporary wooden supports were added. These supports had to be removed each winter and reinstalled each spring. As a permanent solution, the trolley company and the county commissioners agreed to split the cost of a new bridge in 1911. It was to be a three-span concrete arch, though the Meadville Chamber of Commerce wanted an 'impressive' 200 foot single-span arch. As the debate dragged on, the court eventually decided that the Chamber of Commerce could no longer continue an injunction to hold construction. The next day, the local newspaper ran an article about a similar concrete bridge that cracked a short time after construction and needed to be replaced. As a result, public opinion swayed away from building a concrete bridge at all. John Dick, president of the committee of city businessmen, suggested that for 10 percent of the cost of a new structure, the existing bridge could be strengthened. Not wanting to let this opportunity pass up, the commissioners and the trolley company agreed on this solution, and work began shortly thereafter. Installation of the trusses took less than a week and was completed in January of 1912. This solution had the unintended benefit of retaining what has become one of the oldest through truss bridges in America! It its modified form, the bridge carried traffic until its closure in 2007. The bridge is to be demolished sometime around 2012 or 2013. The majority of the community supports demolition, though many outside groups are promoting its preservation. According to the Historic American Engineering Record, ''Mead Avenue, formerly Dock Street, bears the unusual distinction of having two bridges on the same site at one time. Grafted to the original double-intersection Whipple truss built by Penn Bridge Works, external Baltimore trusses help this 1872 structure carry modern traffic loads. This compromise, born of economizing impulse and public turmoil, has allowed the bridge a longer life than might otherwise have been possible.'' The bridge is definitely one to visit prior to its demolition. Retaining its 1872 look, the bridge takes you back to the long lost days of Whipple trusses, Keystone Columns and vertical endposts, decades before bridges were designed for automobiles!",,

Gibbons, assistant county engineer Chris Belleman and county bridge foreman Kenneth McDaniels examined the bridge and designed a new floor system replicating the one used when the bridge was built about 100 years ago, Gibbons said. If the county had opted to tear down the old bridge, the new one would have to be two lanes and cost an estimated $1.5 million due to federal design requirements, Gibbons said. Because the county was repairing an existing bridge, the single-lane structure could remain, he said. The steel needed for the repairs was bid out and cost about $30,000, and the county spent another $5,000 on other materials, Gibbons said.

By the 1960's, it was apparent that the converted railroad bridges were too narrow to handle the volume of traffic they experienced. Furthermore, the converted railroad bridges lacked shoulders. As a result, the Florida Department of Transportation decided to replace all of the bridges, starting with the Bahia Honda Bridge. The old Bahia Honda Bridge was the most dangerous, since the road, built over thru trusses, had a vertical curve in the middle of the bridge. The dual replacement bridges were wide concrete multi-beam bridges, each with two lanes plus shoulders. Due to the high cost of such a bridge, later replacements (such as the Seven Mile Bridge and the Long Key Bridge) were single-lane concrete segmental girders with narrow shoulders.

According to the PAHBI, ''The 1909, pin connected, two span, 256'-long (2 @ 128'), Pratt thru truss bridge is supported on ashlar abutments and an ashlar cutwater pier. The bridge is a complete, handsome example of a pin connected, metal truss bridge with aesthetic details, including cresting and decorative sidewalk railings. It was built by the Canton Bridge Company, a regional fabricator of metal truss bridges. Modifications have been minor, limited to the replacement in 1980 of some floorbeams and stringers, and the strengthening of some truss members by adding cover plate. The bridge also contributes to a potential historic district consisting of the NR-eligible Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad shops to its east and a working class residential neighborhood to its west.'' According to www.mercercotrussbridges.com, ''The construction of the Ohl Street Bridge, located on the Greenville Borough-Hempfield Township line, illustrates the planning and construction process of a metal truss bridge. As the area's industrial center, Greenville expanded south in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and formerly vacant or agricultural land became valued for industrial and residential development. In 1876, E.W. Hodge established the Hodge Manufacturing Company on New Street. Other industries soon joined it. The largest was the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad, which established a major rail yard, repair shops, and a roundhouse in South Greenville. Residential neighborhoods sprang up to house the employees of these plants. A footbridge was erected to allow those living on the west side of the Shenango River to reach these facilities. In September 1907, ''not less than twenty-four resident taxpayers'' of Greenville and Hempfield Township petitioned the Court of Quarter Sessions for a road bridge to replace the footbridge. The six viewers appointed to appraise the crossing agreed that a bridge was necessary and took the somewhat unusual step of recommending details, including type of bridge (single span steel truss), its length (150 ft) and width (40 ft), the need for a sidewalk, and the width of the approach roads leading to the structure. In all likelihood, this indicated that the Mercer County Engineer already knew what type of truss bridge he planned to design. The viewers presented the report to the Grand Jury on October 21, 1907. It was approved two days later. In November, the County Commissioners agreed to pay for the bridge. The Commissioners selected the Canton Bridge Company of Canton, Ohio to construct the bridge. The Pratt through truss bridge constructed by the company was two spans rather than one and, at 256 ft, much longer than the viewers recommended. A contract between Mercer County and the Canton Bridge Company carefully detailed erection specifications. Structural steel was to be used throughout, with the exception of cast steel for shoes and bearings and cast iron for decorative elements such as the bridge nameplates, portal cresting, and railing ornaments. The bridge deck was specified as built up arched corrugated steel plates resting on the lower flanges of the steel stringers to be filled and surfaced with concrete. The center section of the deck was to be much heavier than the rest, in order to support a proposed streetcar line that was never built. This also accounts for the bridge's width. The contract also detailed the dead and live loads the bridge had to accommodate; the degree of workmanship with which it must be erected; and even the approved methods by which it must be assembled. Notably, bridge members were to be erected using rivets driven with pneumatic hammers rather than hammered by hand. However, on-site construction specified the use of pinned connections at the panel points, not rivets. Since the bridge was replacing a footbridge, a broad cantilevered sidewalk was built on the north side of the bridge with provisions made for the possible later addition of a second sidewalk on the south side of the bridge. The Canton Bridge Company completed the Ohl Street Bridge in October 1909. The bridge featured decorative details designed to enhance the bridge's aesthetic appeal. The portal struts were embellished with quarter round sunburst cresting and spherical finials, and the sidewalk railing was artfully composed of overlapping strips of metal and decorated with rosettes. Inspectors appointed by the court to insure that the bridge was built as designed called the Ohl Street Bridge 'first class in every respect.'''",,

The Bahia Honda Channel Bridge's spans varied on channel depth.

Built as an important link between two then prosperous cities, the bridge was fitted with architectural decorations, such as peaked portals with decorative ironwork. Structurally the bridge was impressive, with two spans of 439 feet that were among the longest in the country for a simple truss. An alternate design for the bridge was an unusual configuration of thru arches with lenticular truss lower chords. The bridge was also significant for being the last surviving structure entirely designed by nationally-significant engineer Theodore Cooper. Only a few Union Bridge Company structures still exist anywhere in Pennsylvania. In 1917, Secretary of War Newton Baker issued a mandate that Pittsburgh's Allegheny River bridges must have a minimum clearance of 47 to provide clearance for navigation. In 1927 the bridge was replaced with the current Roberto Clemente Bridge. Instead of demolishing the old bridge, it was separated into four sections, placed on barges, and was moved to cross the Back Channel of the Ohio River in Coraopolis. Two Warren pony approach trusses were added to the Coraopolis approach to span the former P&LE Railroad. By the 1980's the bridge's steel became so brittle that the structure had to be closed whenever the temperature was below 30 degrees F. This caused great inconvenience to anyone who depended on the bridge. As a result, the National Register-Listed bridge was demolished in 1994 to make way for its modern replacement.",,

It is perhaps the only example of a historic truss bridge being reused for an amusement park ride. According to Harry Deitz Book, ''Knoebels an Amusement Park with a Heart,'' Lawrence Knoebel purchased two bridges for the park in 1936. One was the Lawrence Knoebel Covered Bridge, which is still located at the park. According to the book, ''Along with his purchase of the Benton covered bridge, Lawrence Knoebel was the successful bidder at a purchase price of $75 for another bridge that spanned Fishing Creek in Sugarloaf Township. There is no report anywhere on what happened to that bridge, whether it became part of the Knoebel scenery or if it was sold by Lawrence to another interested individual or firm.'' Since the date of the Old Smokey Train Bridge (ca. 1890) predates the park, the bridge was relocated from elsewhere. It is possible that this is the other bridge Lawrence Knoebel purchased. The Old Smokey Train and the Pioneer Train were purchased in 1960, initially running on the same track. According to the Knoebels book, ''Marion Vought, an Elysburg contractor who also was employed by the park, was hired to drain a swamp area, clear trees, construct a tunnel and bridge and lay the one-and-one-half miles of track.'' It is possible that Vought either reused the former Fishing Creek Bridge for the train or relocated a different bridge. The routes of the trains have been modified and separated, so the bridge could have also been relocated during one of the train's track realignments. Knoebels Amusement Resort is one of the premier parks in the nation for historic rides. It is fitting that it also has a historic bridge, one of only a few with Phoenix columns in Pennsylvania.",,

It is the first bypassed bridge to be converted to a park onsite in Pennsylvania. According to Nate Clark to www.historicbridges.org, ''The Historic Quaker Bridge is a 126-foot-long; Victorian-era Cleveland Bridge Company Pratt through-truss near Greenville; Mercer County, Pennsylvania. Built in 1898 to carry Williamson Road over the Little Shenango River in Mercer County, between Erie and Pittsburgh, this strong-yet-graceful pin-connected span was listed on The National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Quaker is believed to be the fourth state-owned historic metal truss bridges yet saved in Pennsylvania, and the FIRST in Western PA. It also is said to be the very first such state-owned bridge in the commonwealth -- vs. wooden covered bridges -- ever to be retired and preserved in-place. At the moment, while its replacement is being completed 100 feet upstream, the existing structure remains in the bridge inventory of PennDOT until it is formally vacated and conveyed, later this summer. The good news is that, after a 33-month-long effort to save it, the scheduled truss bridge razing and scrapping was successfully averted. One more structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places gets to survive. Significantly, the footing for the cut-stone west abutment supporting the truss rests within the canal basin of the 'Erie Extension' of the Beaver and Lake Erie Canal (~1845-1871), between Beaver Falls and Erie, PA. Now, county residents and tourists, alike, will soon have a truly special place to take time out of their hectic lives to stop, relax and enjoy this graceful bridge and its beautiful natural surroundings. They'll be able to picnic next to it and then take a leisurely stroll (or wheelchair ride) across this charming span to absorb and appreciate the dramatic geometry of its elegant, Victorian-era architecture silhouetted against the sky. They'll also have a chance to witness a lone Blue Heron flying just above the river's surface on its morning and evening 'patrols', right under the bridge's open-grate steel deck. There is a variety of other riparian wildlife along the river's banks to be observed, and massive Silver Maple, Sycamore and Black Walnut trees form a natural backdrop that graces the downstream side of the picturesque bridge. Here is a 'thumbnail' background on this structure: Located ~9 miles east of PA/OH state line, and ~1.5 miles northeast of Greenville, Mercer County in PennDOT District 1-0. Carried Williamson Road/SR 4006 over Little Shenango River in Hempfield Township. Single-lane, pin-connected, 126-foot-long Pratt through-truss erected by the Cleveland Bridge Company in 1898. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Worthy preservation candidate was offered to a responsible party through PennDOT's Historic Bridge Marketing Program. Remarkably good physical condition of metal truss, after 108 years of continuous service. New replacement bridge built on different alignment, roughly 100 feet upstream from and nearly parallel with Quaker Bridge. Quaker Bridge remained in service during most of the construction of the new Williamson Road stream crossing. Span to be retired in-place and re-used to provide pedestrian-only 'bridge park' over Little Shenango River. Offers unique ''context-sensitive design'' mitigation for adjacent, modern concrete beam replacement bridge.

The Silver Bridge was an unusual eyebar chain suspension bridge in which the eyebar chain was also the top chord of the stiffening truss at the center and ends of the bridge. The eyebar chains were composed of two eyebars per link of high strength steel (instead of several eyebars per link). Without extra parallel eyebars for redundancy, one broken link could impose excessive loading on the other eyebar, leading to the collapse of the chain and therefore the bridge. This is exactly what happened on December 15, 1967, when a tiny crack in an eyebar became critical. 46 people died in the tragedy. The disaster led to modern bridge inspection standards.

The original Portage Railroad operated from 1834 to 1854. The Skew Arch Bridge was the only roadway bridge built to span the railroad. Since a canal could not be constructed over mountains, a pre-locomotive railroad was built. The canal boats were loaded onto mule and horse pulled rail cars and brought up and down the mountains by a series of 10 inclines. According to HAER, ''This bridge carried the Huntingdon-Blairsville Turnpike, also called the Northern Turnpike, across Inclined Plane No. 6 of the Allegheny Portage Railroad on the east slope of Allegheny Mountain. It was originally designed, and partially built, to be perpendicular to the incline, but in 1833 its alignment was altered to the present skew arrangement, to facilitate the traffic on the steep grade of the turnpike. The firm of Fenlon, Darling, and Company was the contractor for this work. In 1849 one of the wing walls collapsed and was rebuilt. The ashlar stone was cut from local sandstone quarries and the bridge was constructed without mortar. The overall length of the bridge measures 70'.

The truss derives its name from the lens shape created by the upper and lower chords of the span. This 80'-9'' bridge is typical of the early polygonal pony truss designs patented by William O.

The Berlin Iron Bridge Company was the main producer of this unusual truss form, which was erected in many rural and urban settings throughout the United States between 1878 and 1900.''

Built-up fishbelly floorbeams support steel stringers and a wood deck with wood railings inside of the truss lines. The bridge has been altered by the addition of extra diagonals in the second and fourth panels and plate welded to the upper chords and end posts (ca. 1960). The alterations are noteworthy but not considered significant enough to adversely affect the integrity of the rare bridge type and design. Lenticular truss bridges were a patented design of the Berlin Iron Bridge Co. of Berlin, CT. The company fabricated and erected hundreds of lenticular truss bridges throughout primarily New England and New York from the late 1870s to 1900. Pennsylvania was not a major market for Berlin Iron Bridge, but the company did erect a modest number of bridges in the state, especially in some northern tier counties. No less than five lenticular truss highway bridges from 1878 to 1900 have been identified in Pennsylvania.

While the main arched continuous truss has the same dimensions as the bridge at Elizabeth, the Speers-Belle Vernon Bridge is longer, with deck truss approaches on each side. With the passage of the Interstate Highway Act, LR 268 and the bridge were expanded to be part of I-70 (originally I-70S). In the 1992-1993 renovation, sloped trusses were added to widen the approach deck trusses, lengthening the acceleration and deceleration lanes for the interchanges at each end of the bridge. (Dating from before interstate standards were put in place, the original bridge does not meet current standards.) The structure was repainted white from dark green during the renovation. Although the design of the bridge is not unusual, it is one of only three such bridges in Pennsylvania.

Constructed over Bryan's original town site, this major new gateway afforded access to the western edge of downtown Dallas. After razing buildings, engineers sloped three major streets down to the west to converge into one. These three streets -- Elm to the north, Main in the center, and Commerce on the south -- pass beneath a railroad bridge that connected the rail yards on the north to Union Terminal Station two blocks to the south. This structural triangular arrangement is known locally as the triple underpass, a civic accomplishment of engineering genius. The arched gateway, constructed of concrete with distinctive Art Deco-style detailing, opened to wide acclaim and created a commanding entrance to the city from the west and an impressive exit from the east.

The bridge is a source of community identity, with bridge-themed art on the Pittston side. According to the PAHBI, ''The 5 span, 1016'-long steel pin-connected Parker thru truss bridge built in 1914 is traditionally composed of eye bar tension members and built-up compression members of standard sections. It is supported on stone piers and abutments with extensive concrete repairs including concrete caps, and encased or replaced cutwaters. The deck, stringers, and truss bearings were replaced in 1984. Welded repairs included plate welded to some diagonals at the lower panel points. Original railings have been replaced by W-beam guide rails at the roadway face of the trusses and a tubular metal railing at the cantilevered sidewalk. The altered bridge is a late example of the pin-connected truss bridge type/design that was introduced about 1870 by engineer Charles Parker. The Parker truss is a variation of the Pratt truss with a polygonal top chord. The type/design continued to be used for longer span crossings through the first decades of the 20th century because of economy of design, ease of erection, and pin connections, which were still considered a favorable means of handling secondary stresses in longer span trusses. The bridge was fabricated by the Penn Bridge Co., a prolific builder in the state since the 1870s.''",,

It is a very rare example (possibly the only example left) of a wrought iron continuous pony truss from the 1870's. In most cases, such a bridge would have been two simple pony trusses or one thru truss. Before computers were used for bridge calculations beginning in the 1950's, continuous trusses were avoided due to the difficulty of calculating forces about a center pier. It is not known why this rare and unusual continuous truss was built. The bridge is also significant for being possibly the only surviving bridge of the West Penn Bridge Company, which became the Penn Bridge Company in 1879. The company moved to New Brighton, also in Beaver County. Note the unusual detail of the diagonal endpost connection with the top chord. As with other Penn Bridge Company bridges, the diagonal and the vertical are connected with separate pins. The top chord projects over the diagonal endpost. Though the bridge is sparsely used (about 50 cars a day), it is in poor condition and therefore in danger of replacement. Since the bridge is at a sharp angle of Watts Mill Road, the bridge could be a candidate for being bypassed by a new alignment. Since it is a relatively small pony truss, it could also be a candidate for relocation. If the bridge becomes available for reuse, it will be marketed on the PennDOT Bridge Marketing page.",,

According to the Historic American Engineering Record, ''The Wheeling Bridge is perhaps the most important extant antebellum civil engineering structure in North America.'' What makes the bridge so significant? Arguably it is the bridge which proved the adaptability and usefulness of the suspension design. The modern form of the suspension bridge (one with towers and a level deck) was first built in 1801 in western Pennsylvania by James Finley. However, early suspension bridges used iron chains, in which one broken link led to a total bridge collapse. While many similar bridges were initially built, the type was all but abandoned in America within 20 years. However, engineers in Europe began to improve and advance the suspension bridge design. Charles Ellet studied in Europe and began to design revolutionary suspension bridges in America. Since the 1830's, he had proposed suspension bridge designs that could span 1,000 feet, which at the time was thought to be impossible. Finally, in the 1840's, he got the chance to build such a bridge when he beat John Roebling for the commission for a bridge over the Ohio River at Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia). The 1,010 foot Wheeling Suspension Bridge, the first bridge ever built over the Ohio River and America's oldest surviving suspension bridge built as a vehicular bridge, opened in 1849 after three years of construction. Unfortunately, just five years later the bridge collapsed in a windstorm. The bridge was rebuilt by John Roebling (who also designed the Brooklyn Bridge). Roebling modified the bridge by replacing Ellet's cables (comprised of separate strands fastened together) with his wire rope. In addition, diagonal cable stays were added from the towers to stiffen the bridge and to match other Roebling bridges. The bridge has been refurbished many times since, enabling it to still carry vehicular traffic 160 years after it first opened. Today, engineers continue to build record-breaking long-span designs. As of 2009, the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan is the longest, with a main span of 6,532 feet. In the early 1800's, a 1,000 foot span was thought to be impossible. In the early to mid 21st century, a $7.5 billion bridge to connect the Italian Peninsula with Sicily is to be built spanning 2 miles! This is what the Wheeling Suspension Bridge started!!!",,

The bridge was built by Samuel White of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, using Phoenix Columns manufactured by the Phoenix Bridge Company. The South Park Street Bridge consisted of two spans. When the bridge was closed in the early 1900's, Col. S.C. Lewis, President of the Atlantic Refining Company, began to lobby for a new bridge, which was constructed in 1909. The old bridge was dismantled and stored. The central pier and western abutment for the South Park Street Bridge still remain. In 1911, the Venango County Commissioners recommended that the county assist in building a new bridge over Sugar Creek in Plum Township near the Valley School House. A contracted was awarded to James Smith and W.R. Flickner for $700 In November of 1911, the commissioners advertized for bids for ''the arranging, cutting and fitting up the necessary parts taken from the old South Park Street Bridge, and for the erection and construction of a span 72 feet 4 inches long, to be erected upon masonry abutments now ... being erected and built at the site of what is known as the Shorts Bridge.'' The Williams Road Bridge was completed in the summer of 1912. The bridge carried Williams Road with little alteration until the late 1900's, when supplementary stringers were added to reinforce the connections along the bottom chord. According to HAER, ''Williams Road Bridge is a unique vernacular example of a late-nineteenth century pin-connected Pratt through truss adapted for re-use as a county bridge in the late twentieth century. It is of engineering interest for its rare patented Phoenix columns, manufactured by the Phoenix Bridge Company of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.'' According to the PAHBI, ''The ca. 1880 bridge is a rare example of a pin connected Pratt thru truss bridge fabricated with Phoenix columns. It does not have the Phoenix Iron Co.'s patented connecting pieces, indicating that the columns were ordered from Phoenix but assembled into a bridge with local thinking about connections. A simple sleeve with pin plates has been used for both upper and lower panel point connections with those for the upper ones inside the built up upper chords.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The bridge was bypassed in 1984 and subsequently abandoned. As a result, this historic bridge is still standing for new generations to enjoy. The bridge is historically significant for many reasons. It is considered a camelback Pennsylvania truss since the truss has five distinct panels. This is a rare configuration with few bridges remaining nationally with this configuration. Furthermore, the bridge was built by the Wrought Iron Bridge Company of Canton, Ohio, a nationally significant bridge fabricator. It is possibly the only known Wrought Iron Bridge Company Pennsylvania truss still standing anywhere. The bridge has an usual detail of light compression members between the eyebars along the bottom chord. A truss bridge functions as a beam. When a load is applied, the span bends downward. The top chord acts in compression and the bottom in tension. For this reason, pin-connected truss bridges have eyebars along the bottom chord and built-up compression members along the top chord. Why would there be both compression and tension members along the low chord with this bridge? It is possible that with a Pennsylvania truss bridge, the vertical members are placed far apart. Engineers may have added the compression members to resist buckling or to add stiffness to the long, thin eyebars between the panels. Had the bridge been demolished instead of abandoned, the potentially nationally significant bridge would have been lost. 26 years later (when this entry was written), the bridge can still be demolished.
